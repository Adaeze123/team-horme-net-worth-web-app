                            Net worth calculator (web) is a platform that calculate your assets and cash details. It
                            gives how much the user worth. Net worth is the combined value of your assets, or the things
                            you own that have monetary value minus the value of your liabilities. It is important to
                            know your net worth. If your assets exceed your liabilities, you have a positive net worth
                            and if your liabilities are greater than your assets, you have a negetive net worth.
